Bike Farm Ox
============
We aim to write micro web services to help Bike Farm's shop operations. We have a desire to create a better user experience for our volunteer\member time tracking and our cash log. We currently use Google Forms and Google Docs to handle user input and data storage. The limits of these applications are hindering any furthur development on our goals so we are figure out a new solution.

Project Planning
---------------
This project will start with an ___exploratory phase___, then an ___build out phase___, then a ___deployment and enhancment phase___.  The ___exploratory phase___ will define what our architecture will be and determine the detailed requirements to reach pairity with our current system. The ___build out phase___ will build, test, and gain approval from Bike Farm. It should have pairity with the current system at the very least. Finally, the ___deployment and enhancement phase___ will take our new system live and we will continue to maintain the software. Ideally we will complete the first two phases in a minimal amount of time, and the last phase will allow iterative development of new features and bug fixes.
